## Acknowledgement
This is a code-oriented file for demonstrating quantitative data analysis methods, therefore, the cases and diseases in the datasets are not closely described. 
I acknowledge the cases are lively humans suffering from diseases. Hope the application of data analysis can help with medical, mental, and societal improvement on the whole population. Bless for recovery. 

## General info
This file demonstrates codes for:
* Basic: read datasets, remove missing data, create dataframes, create tables, get certain statistic numbers.
* Continuous data: measure of spread, present descriptive summary, visualize descriptive data in multiple ways.
* Categorical data: Classify continuous data into categorical data, visualize categorical data.
* Test for mean: one sample t-test, two sample t-test (unpaired and paired). 
* Test for proportion: one sample z-test, one sample exact binomial test, two sample paired test, chi-square test, fisher test for small sample, mcnemar for paired binary data.
* Correlation
	
## Technologies
Project is created with R 4.1.1:
* library(tidyverse)
* library(rigr)
* library(knitr)
* library(dplyr)
* library(epiR)
	
## Note
The datasets' names I used in this file include wcgs, fp, aug, heart, chs_recode, carotine, mri, psa, and sep.
Those datasets are public accessible or made-up for demonstration.
